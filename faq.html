                            <p>Unfortunately, NO. Medicare only covers acute skilled care, usually after a hospital stay. We can work in conjunction with your Medicare provider to ensure your loved one is receiving the appropriate amount of care.</p>

                            <p>NO, there is no pre-authorization required. Nor is there any certification, pre-qualification, or doctor&rsquo;s prescription required.
